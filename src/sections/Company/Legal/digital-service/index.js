              Welcome to Layer5, Inc. Founded in 2020 as a remote-first company, Layer5 is an open-source innovator and community dedicated to empowering engineers to extract greater value from their infrastructure. We are the creators and maintainers of Meshery, the cloud native management platform that began its journey in July 2019 to simplify the adoption and operation of cloud native infrastructure. Today, Meshery stands as a CNCF incubating project with over 5,000 GitHub stars, alongside our other offerings like Layer5 Cloud and Kanvas. Our mission is to champion developer-defined infrastructure, enabling collaborative design and management of multi-cluster, multi-cloud environments while fostering an inclusive, global community of cloud native enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Layer5, we are committed to fostering a safe, transparent, and trustworthy online environment for our users, customers, and community members across our digital platforms, including layer5.io, meshery.dev, getnighthawk.dev, cloud.layer5.io, kanvas.new, and our open-source community hubs (e.g., GitHub, Slack). This Digital Services Notice outlines how we manage user-generated content, ensure transparency, and protect user rights, reflecting our core values of integrity, collaboration, and paying it forward.

            <h3>Our History and Commitment to Open Source</h3>
            <p>
              Layer5's origins trace back to a group of service mesh pioneers who recognized the need for better tools to manage the complexities of cloud native architectures. Established in 2020, we built upon the foundational work of Meshery, launched in 2019 as an extensible platform for designing and operating Kubernetes workloads. Our remote-first model from day one has allowed us to tap into a diverse, global talent pool, creating an inclusive environment where contributors from around the world collaborate on open-source projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              As leaders in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)—with representatives on the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), as Docker Captains, Linkerd maintainers, Cloud Native Ambassadors, Kubernetes authors and trainers, and chairs of CNCF Working Groups—Layer5 is at the forefront of cloud native standards. Milestones like Meshery's progression to CNCF incubation and our growing community of collaborators underscore our dedication to open source. We host global meetups, support initiatives like Open Source Africa, and encourage participation in our projects, ensuring our digital services remain community-driven and transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              This commitment to openness directly informs our approach to digital services: by prioritizing collaboration and accessibility, we create platforms that not only innovate but also safeguard user trust and safety.
            </p>
            <h3>User Activity and Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              Layer5 operates several digital platforms, including Layer5 Community (https://layer5.io/community), Meshery (https://meshery.io), Layer5 Cloud (https://cloud.layer5.io), Kanvas (https://kanvas.new), and GitHub repositories (layer5io repositories on github.com). We are committed to transparency regarding user activity and content moderation to maintain a safe and productive environment. In compliance with U.S. regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we do not engage in practices that would constitute a "sale" of personal information as defined by the CCPA.
            </p>
            <p>
              We monitor user activity to improve our services and ensure compliance with our policies. Aggregated and anonymized data may be used to analyze platform usage, but we do not disclose individual user data unless required by law or to protect the safety and integrity of our platforms. Our community-first ethos ensures that transparency extends to how we handle contributions, feedback, and interactions across our ecosystem.
            </p>
            <h3>Single Point of Contact</h3>

            <p>
              Layer5 provides mechanisms for users, authorities, or other parties to report illegal or inappropriate content on our platforms. You can submit reports concerning content on Layer5 Community, Meshery, Layer5 Cloud, Kanvas, or our GitHub repositories by emailing <a href="mailto:abuse@layer5.io">abuse@layer5.io</a> or using any available "report" functionality on our platforms (e.g., within community forums or GitHub issues). We review reports promptly and notify reporters of our actions, offering an opportunity to appeal decisions if they disagree. This process aligns with our inclusive community guidelines, ensuring swift resolution while upholding open dialogue.
            </p>
            <h3>Content Moderation</h3>
            <p>
              Our <a href="/company/legal/acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</a> prohibits the use of Layer5 platforms (collectively, the "Layer5 Service") for content or activities that promote, encourage, or facilitate illegal activity, hate speech, threatening or abusive behavior, violence, infringing content, or discrimination based on characteristics such as race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, age, disability, or other protected characteristics under applicable U.S. law. Users or organizations engaging in such activities are prohibited from using Layer5’s products and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              We maintain a robust content moderation program to identify, review, and address violations of our AUP or platform guidelines. This program includes internal policies and guidelines to ensure consistent, fair, and equitable enforcement across our user base. We apply objective criteria to evaluate content and prioritize user safety. Users whose content is removed are notified and may appeal the decision if they believe it was made in error. Drawing from our open-source roots, we encourage community input on moderation practices to keep them aligned with our values of kindness and inclusivity.
            </p>
            <h3>Transparency Reporting</h3>
            <p>
              Layer5 is committed to transparency in our operations. We publish periodic transparency reports on our <a href="/company/legal/trust-center">Trust Center</a>, detailing aggregated data on content moderation actions, user reports, and appeals across our platforms. These reports aim to provide insight into our efforts to maintain a safe and positive online environment while respecting user privacy and rights. As a community-powered organization, these reports also highlight contributions and collaborative achievements, reinforcing our shared commitment to ethical digital practices.
